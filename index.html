            <h2>Elevator Pitch</h2>
                <p> SleepSync helps late night coders and gamers build healthier sleep habits by
              gently aligning screen time with personalized wind‑down routines. With smart
            prompts and progress insights, SleepSync makes it easier
         to log off, relax, and wake up refreshed.</p>

        <section id="problem">
            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>Staring at a computer screen all night can make falling asleep difficult. Individuals can easily lose track of time, 
                news and media stimulants keep the brain active, and the blue light reduces melatonin production. Due to these factors, 
                coders and gamers are generally known to have irregular sleep schedules.</p>
            <p>When people stay up late, they need to wake up later to retain enough sleep. However, not everyone’s schedule allows time 
                for late mornings despite staying up late. They still need to be up for work, class, fitness, etc. This leads to coders and 
                gamers getting a lot less sleep than they need.</p>
