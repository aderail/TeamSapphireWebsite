            <h2>Elevator Pitch</h2>
                <p> SleepSync helps late night coders and gamers build healthier sleep habits by
              gently aligning screen time with personalized wind‑down routines. With smart
            prompts and progress insights, SleepSync makes it easier
         to log off, relax, and wake up refreshed.</p>

        <section id="problem" class="page-section">
            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>Staring at a computer screen all night can make falling asleep difficult. Individuals can easily lose track of time, 
                news and media stimulants keep the brain active, and the blue light reduces melatonin production. Due to these factors, 
                coders and gamers are generally known to have irregular sleep schedules.</p>
            <p>When people stay up late, they need to wake up later to retain enough sleep. However, not everyone’s schedule allows time 
                for late mornings despite staying up late. They still need to be up for work, class, fitness, etc. This leads to coders and 
                gamers getting a lot less sleep than they need.</p>

        <section id="customer and user" class="page-section">
            <h2>Our Customers and Users</h2>
            <P>The primary users of the sleep app include parents, students, and general tech users seeking to improve their sleep habits and 
                overall well-being. Parents may use the app to monitor their sleep patterns, establish bedtime routines for their children, or access 
                guided relaxation tools to help the whole family rest better. Students, often facing irregular schedules and high stress, can 
                use features like sleep tracking, breathing exercises, and relaxing music to promote healthier sleep cycles and improve academic 
                performance. Tech users may also use the app to manage screen time before bed, track sleep data, and utilize the automatic blue light
                for easier rest.</P>
            <p>The customers for the app extend beyond individual users to include professionals and organizations that might recommend it as a supportive
                 tool. These include psychologists, therapists, pediatricians, and wellness coaches who can refer the app to their clients as part of treatment
                  or lifestyle guidance. Schools, universities, and workplaces may also serve as customers by promoting or integrating the app into wellness 
                  programs to help students and employees manage stress and sleep health.</p>
            <p>By catering to both direct users and professional customers, the app positions itself as a versatile resource that bridges personal self-care
                 and expert-guided health support. This dual focus helps expand the app’s impact — improving individual sleep outcomes while empowering professionals 
                 to extend their care beyond traditional sessions or office visits.</p>
